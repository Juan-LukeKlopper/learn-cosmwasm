CW721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens based on CosmWasm. Its name and design comply with Ethereum's ERC721 standard while incorporating some additional extensions to suit Cosmos-based blockchain needs.

The types defined in the CW721 Spec can be referenced to implement or invoke the standard CW721 contract. CW721 itself is just a mold. You can refer to this specification to call another NFT contract or implement NFT according to your service.

## About Code

The CW721 Spec is divided into several parts. The contract does not need to implement all of this functionality, but all codes classified as Base must be implemented.

## 1. OwnerOf

```Rust
OwnerOf {
  token_id: String,
  /// unset or false will filter out expired approvals, you must set to true to see them
  include_expired: Option<bool>,
},
```

```Rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct OwnerOfResponse {
    /// Owner of the token
    pub owner: String,
    /// If set this address is approved to transfer/send the token as well
    pub approvals: Vec<Approval>,
}
```

Returns the owner of the given `token_id`. It also returns addresses that have approval on this token. Returns an error if queried about a token that does not exist.

The return type is `OwnerOfResponse`.

If `include_expired` is not set or set to false, the expired approvals are ignored. On the other hand, if you want to see expired approvals, you have to set the value to true.

## 2. Approval

```Rust
Approval {
  token_id: String,
  spender: String,
  include_expired: Option<bool>,
},
```

```Rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct Approval {
    /// Account that can transfer/send the token
    pub spender: String,
    /// When the Approval expires (maybe Expiration::never)
    pub expires: Expiration,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct ApprovalResponse {
    pub approval: Approval,
}
```

Returns the approval information for the `spender` of `token_id` token. Returns an error if approval information is not found.

The return type is `ApprovalResponse`.

If `include_expired` is not set or set to false, the expired approvals are ignored. On the other hand, if you want to see expired approvals, you have to set the value to true.

## 3. Approvals

```Rust
Approvals {
  token_id: String,
  include_expired: Option<bool>,
},
```

```Rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct ApprovalsResponse {
    pub approvals: Vec<Approval>,
}
```

Returns all authorized users who have access to token `token_id`.

The return type is `ApprovalsResponse`.

If `include_expired` is not set or set to false, the expired approvals are ignored. On the other hand, if you want to see expired approvals, you have to set the value to true.

## 4. AllOperators

```Rust
AllOperators {
  owner: String,
  /// unset or false will filter out expired items, you must set to true to see them
  include_expired: Option<bool>,
  start_after: Option<String>,
  limit: Option<u32>,
},
```

```Rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct OperatorsResponse {
    pub operators: Vec<Approval>,
}
```

Returns all `operators` authorized by `owner`. 

The return type is `OperatorsResponse`.

If `include_expired` is not set or set to false, the expired approvals are ignored. On the other hand, if you want to see expired approvals, you have to set the value to true.

If `start_after` is not set, the query will be returned from the beginning in a dictionary order for `operators`. If `start_after` is set, it returns `operators` as many as `limit` from that address.

## 5. NumTokens

```Rust
NumTokens {},
```

```Rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
pub struct NumTokensResponse {
    pub count: u64,
}
```

Returns the number of all issued tokens.
The return type is `NumTokensResponse`.

There is `ReceiveNft` on the opposite side of `SendNft`. 

`ReceiveNft` is a specification that must be implemented by any contract that wants to handle the CW721 token. Usually, not the specification that the CW721 contract itself should implement.

The address of CW721 implementation, sending the `SendNft` message, is handled by `env.sender` and cannot be falsified.

Contracts dealing with `ReceiveNft` should ensure that this sender address matches the token contract address before executing it.

## Cw721ReceiveMsg

```Rust
/// Cw721ReceiveMsg should be de/serialized under 'Receive()' variant in a ExecuteMsg
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct Cw721ReceiveMsg {
    pub sender: String,
    pub token_id: String,
    pub msg: Binary,
}
```

The `sender` is the address from which you want to send the token.

`token_id` is the unique ID of the token.

`msg` is a binary that can be decoded into contract-specific messages or arbitrary data. It can be empty if you want to execute only the default action.

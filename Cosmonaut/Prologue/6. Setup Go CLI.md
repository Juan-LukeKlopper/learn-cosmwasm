If the wallet registration for the test was successfully done, wasmd would print out the information. 
Although it is a testnet, keep the mnemonic separately in a safe place in case of losing a password.

As you know, all activities on the blockchain cost a fee. So you will need some tokens for interaction.

There are two native tokens here.

- `ROCK` (urock): Used to be a validator.
- `PEBBLE` (upebble): Used to pay fees.

```bash
source <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosmWasm/testnets/master/malaga-420/defaults.env)

# add wallets for testing
wasmd keys add wallet
wasmd keys add wallet2
```

We want a fee to publish transaction, so we need to ask for an upebble.

The following command requests some tokens from the faucet. Note that `denom` is upebble.

- Set the environment variable named JSON.
- Use JSON as data when calling
`https://faucet.malaga-420.cosmwasm.com/credit` via `curl`.

```bash
JSON=$(jq -n --arg addr $(wasmd keys show -a wallet) '{"denom":"umlg","address":$addr}')
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$JSON" https://faucet.malaga-420.cosmwasm.com/credit
JSON=$(jq -n --arg addr $(wasmd keys show -a wallet2) '{"denom":"umlg","address":$addr}')
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$JSON" https://faucet.malaga-420.cosmwasm.com/credit
JSON=$(jq -n --arg addr $(wasmd keys show -a wallet) '{"denom":"umlg","address":$addr}')
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$JSON" https://faucet.malaga-420.cosmwasm.com/credit
JSON=$(jq -n --arg addr $(wasmd keys show -a wallet2) '{"denom":"umlg","address":$addr}')
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "$JSON" https://faucet.malaga-420.cosmwasm.com/credit

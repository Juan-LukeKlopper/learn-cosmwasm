It would help if you also had an environment where the contract runs. You can build a local network to deploy and test the contracts you have created, but you can also use a network that already exists publically.

Currently, The Malaga testnet is running actively. You can find out whether it is working well or not from the following URL.

`rpc.malaga-420.cosmwasm.com`
`faucet.malaga-420.cosmwasm.com`

Also, you can check the details through Block Explorer:

`block-explorer.malaga-420.cosmwasm`

You can use `wasmd` or `Node REPL` to communicate with this network.

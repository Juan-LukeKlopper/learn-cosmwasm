`CosmJS`, a type script library, allows you to process queries and transaction registrations. There is also `@cosmjs/cli` which is similar to a Node console.

Let's use the `REPL` environment to do the same thing as the `Go CLI` above.

```JavaScript
// Create or load account
const mnemonic = loadOrCreateMnemonic('fred.key')
mnemonicToAddress(mnemonic)

const {address, client} = await connect(mnemonic, {})
address

client.getAccount()
// if empty - this only works with CosmWasm
hitFaucet(defaultFaucetUrl, address, 'PEBBLE')
client.getAccount()
```

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --help
```

`rustup` is one of the easiest ways to install Rust.

```bash
# create & enter hello_world directory
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```

You can use the Package Manager, the standalone installer, or build directly from the source code. Nevertheless, it is much easier and faster to use `rustup`.

# Check Rust Installation

```bash
# create main.rs
$ vi main.rs
```

We will make a simple "Hello, world!" example to ensure that Rust is installed well.

Just as a Python file ends with a py extension, the Rust file ends with an rs extension.

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Fill in the file main.rs as follows.

```bash
# compile
$ rustc main.rs

# $ ls
# main main.rs

# execute
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```

That's it! Now save the file, and try the following command. This command compiles and executes the main.rs file.

Look at the "Hello, world!" printout on the terminal!

# Cargo

```bash
$ cargo --version
```

`Cargo` is the package manager of Rust. You can easily download and build the library through the cargo.

If you followed a typical Rust installation, `Cargo` would also be installed.

`CosmWasm` is a smart contract written in Web Assembly for the cosmos ecosystem and is also a virtual machine (VM) that executes Web Assembly bytecode on the blockchain.

While Web Assembly allows programs written in several existing and new languages, `CosmWasm` smart contract is almost always written in `Rust` to enhance security. Thanks to an intelligent and industrious compiler,`Rust` can prevent explicit and implicit issues both at a compile time.

In this chapter, let's build an environment where you can conveniently code `Cosmos` and `CosmWasm` programs.

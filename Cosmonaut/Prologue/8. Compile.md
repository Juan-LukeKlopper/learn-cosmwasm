Let's compile an example contract and create a wasm binary executable. It is based on `cw-contracts`, which has many examples.

We will use a famous one, `nameservice`.

First, get the code from Github.

```bash
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts
cd cw-contracts
git checkout main
cd contracts/nameservice
```

rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html

`rustup` allows you to compile with a more explicitly specified toolchain. The toolchain contains several lists and components. By specifying it, a project can be compiled with a specific channel (stable, nightly, beta) and settings.

We will use the stable toolchain in this example.

```bash
# compile the wasm contract with stable toolchain
rustup default stable
cargo wasm
```

If you want to eliminate unnecessary code from compiling, type the following command.

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
```

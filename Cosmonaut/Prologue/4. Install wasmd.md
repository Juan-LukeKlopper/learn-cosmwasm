# Installation | CosmWasm Documentation

wasmd, the core of CosmWasm platform, is the Cosmos Zone implementation which supports smart contract.

It is an addition of x/wasm based on cosmos/gaia. That is, the wasmd binaries behave like gaiad, with the x/wasm moduleâ€™s functionality. If someone is going to develop a smart contract, he should use a wasmd.

To install wasmd, Go must be installed and PATH must be set well.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd.git
$ cd wasmd

# replace the v0.30.0 with the most stable version
$ git checkout v0.30.0
$ make install

# verify the installation
$ wasmd version
```

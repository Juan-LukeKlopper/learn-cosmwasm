This is a subfolder where I follow along with the lessons provided by Area52.io, These lessons will handle concepts from beginner to intermediate difficulty.

## Lesson 1 - An Initial Dive into Entry Points and Instantiate

In this lesson, I'll get ourselves familiar with the basics of CosmWasm, focusing on the first entry point into a CosmWasm smart contract, 'instantiate'

## Lesson 2 - Moving on to Query and Execute

Last lesson, we dove into the `instantiate` entry point, which is how a contract is initialized and deployed to the blockchain. In CosmWasm, there are two additional entry points to consider: `execute` and `query`.
